Device(s):
    <Insert ACE and context name>
        -If this is on a dedicated client switch, document the IP and any special login procedures for the switch

Communication:**
    <Pre-Maintenance communication requirements will be defined by the client>

PreCheck:**
    Take a snapshot of the current context configuration and document it in the ticket notes or attachments
        show run

########## Execution Steps ##########
1) Log into the customer context using SecurID credentials.  From a network jump box:
ssh <ace name>
changeto <context name>

2) Confirm that you are in the active context.  *Changes should only be made in the active context*
  -Note: When adding an SSL Key or Cert, it needs to be added to BOTH the active and standby context BEFORE a write mem is performed
    show ft group status
        check to ensure that "My State" is Active, and "Peer State" is Standby Hot.
            My State                     : FSM_FT_STATE_ACTIVE
            Peer State                   : FSM_FT_STATE_STANDBY_HOT

3) Execute scripted changes
config t
<Scripted lines of configuration that can be copied and pasted into the ACE.  For creating a new VIP, use the New ACE VIP utility to silplify the process>
write mem

Validation:**
    <Define any steps that can be taken to verify the change is working.  Whenever possible, test a VIP using a web browser to verify functionality and check for SSL issues if applicable.>

Communication:**
    <Specific communication requirements may be defined by the client.  If no special instructions are provided, include the name and contact information for the requestor to be used for post-maintenance notification.>


** Indicates there should be a output to Ticketing System with a specific note.
